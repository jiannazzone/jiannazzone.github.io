                    This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure
                    of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

                <p>
                    No information is collected during the use of this app.
                    All calculations, storage, and other related logic happens on the device.

                    If you choose to Restore Purchase, the device will contact Apple's servers to authenticate the
                    previous purchase.
